The program is named by simulation and two input parameters are required: 

the 1st one is the number of simulations run on EACH processor; 
the 2nd one is the name of output file. 

The output data contains two lines: 

the 1st line is 21 integers indicating the range of histogram with even intervals seperated by ","; 
the 2nd line is 20 integers indicating the number of susceptible cases that belongs to each intervals respectively.

Example: mpirun -np 5 ./simulation 1000 result

The instruction stands that the program is run on 5 different processors
parallel and for each processor, 1000 simulations will be done. Therefore, in
total 5*1000 simulations will be done and statistics for histogram will be done
as well. Finally the result will be save in the given output file in the format
of described above.
