The program is named by simulation and two input parameters are required: 

the 1st one is the number of simulations run on EACH processor; 
the 2nd one is the name of output file. 

The output data contains a series of integers and is saved in a ascii-coded file
seperated by ",". Output data are numbers of susceptible people of all simulations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: mpirun -np 5 ./simulation 1000 result

The instruction stands that the program is run on 5 different processors
parallel and for each processor, 1000 simulations will be done. Therefore, in
total 5*1000 simulations will be done and will be save in the file named result.
